    car to buy an Audi A5, which I ended up having to fix a thing or two on.
    Since then, I've bought a few cars. I'll list them below:

  <p>Since I started to learn how to work on car engines, I figured I might 
      dip my toes into motorcycles as well. Here are the bikes I've bought and fixed.
